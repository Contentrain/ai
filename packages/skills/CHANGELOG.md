# @contentrain/skills

## 0.2.1

### Patch Changes

- fe97f7b: Rewrite git transaction system with dedicated `contentrain` branch and full worktree isolation.

  **@contentrain/mcp:**

  - Eliminate stash/checkout/merge on developer's working tree during auto-merge
  - All git operations happen in temporary worktrees — developer's tree never mutated
  - Dedicated `contentrain` branch as content state single source of truth
  - Feature branches use `cr/` prefix (avoids git ref namespace collision)
  - Auto-merge flow: feature → contentrain → update-ref baseBranch (fast-forward)
  - Selective sync: only changed files copied to working tree, dirty files skipped with warning
  - context.json committed with content (not separately)
  - Structured errors with code, message, agent_hint, developer_action
  - Automatic migration of old `contentrain/*` branches on first operation

  **@contentrain/types:**

  - Add `SyncResult` interface for selective file sync results
  - Add `ContentrainError` interface for structured error reporting
  - Add `CONTENTRAIN_BRANCH` constant

  **contentrain (CLI):**

  - Worktree merge pattern in diff, serve approve, normalize approve
  - Contentrain branch status display in `contentrain status`
  - Protected contentrain branch in branch listings

  **@contentrain/rules & @contentrain/skills:**

  - Updated workflow documentation for new git architecture

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 2bf3f65: feat(rules,skills,cli): migrate to Agent Skills standard format

  **@contentrain/rules:**

  - Add `essential/contentrain-essentials.md` — compact always-loaded guardrails (~86 lines)
  - Remove `ide/` directory and `scripts/build-rules.ts` (IDE-specific build system)
  - Replace `ALL_SHARED_RULES`, `IDE_RULE_FILES` exports with `ESSENTIAL_RULES_FILE`
  - Always-loaded context reduced from 2,945 lines to 86 lines (97% reduction)

  **@contentrain/skills:**

  - Add `skills/` directory with 15 Agent Skills (SKILL.md + references/) following agentskills.io standard
  - Add `AGENT_SKILLS` catalog export for Tier 1 discovery (name + description)
  - New `contentrain-sdk` skill for @contentrain/query usage (local + CDN)
  - Existing `workflows/` and `frameworks/` kept for backward compatibility

  **contentrain (CLI):**

  - Rewrite `installRules()` with generic IDE installer supporting Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, and GitHub Copilot
  - Install one compact essential guardrails file per IDE (always-loaded) + Agent Skills directories (on-demand)
  - Automatic cleanup of old granular rule files from previous versions
