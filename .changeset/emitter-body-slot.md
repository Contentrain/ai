Single-injection body chrome. `ChromeChunk` gains a `body` position carrying the new `CHROME_BODY_SLOT` marker (`<!--@@body@@-->`) at any nesting depth — real themes nest the content container (`article > div.entry-content`), so before/after halves are unbalanced fragments the parser silently "repairs" (measured: 36 vs 100). The emitter splices content in at the marker and injects the whole body as ONE fragment; the legacy `before_body`/`after_body` pair still works by composing into a single string. Generated pages pass content via the `body` prop; slot children still work through `Astro.slots.render`.
